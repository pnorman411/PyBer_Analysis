# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

As a data analyst with a python-based ridesharing app company, I was tasked with analyzing thousands of rows of data to aid executive decision-making around access and affordability for underserved neighborhoods.  This portion of the project summarizes total number of rides and drivers along with total and average fares, for rural, suburban, and urban ridesharing.  The analysis also includes plotting and trending weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

### Ridesharing Dataframe

The total rides and number of drivers in the urban setting far exceed the suburban and rural totals with 1,625 total rides and 2,405 total drivers.  The total rides for suburban and rural were 625 and 125 with 490 and 78 drivers respectively.  The average fare per ride and per driver was the lowest in the urban setting at $24.53 per ride and $16.57 per driver, while the rural averages were the highest at $34.62 per ride and $55.49 per driver.  With the highest volume of rides, the urban setting produced the highest total fares over four months grossing $39,854.38.  Suburban totals for the same timeframe were $19,356.33, and although rural fares averaged the highest per ride and per driver rate, the total fares grossed $4,327.93.

## Summary

### Urban Rideshare Setting

The analysis shows that the sheer volume of rides in the urban setting produced the most total fares.  The urban setting also averaged the lowest fares per ride and per driver, so for strategic decision-making it is recommended to continue to hire and keep a substantial pool of drivers in the urban setting which grosses the highest total fares.

### Suburban Rideshare Setting

The suburban setting yielded 38.5% of the number of rides that the urban setting did, yet only had 20.4% of the drivers that the urban setting did all the while producing 48.6% of the urban setting's total fares.  There is revenue potential in the suburban setting and increasing access and affordability to underserved neighborhoods would mean increasing the number of drivers in the suburban setting.

### Rural Rideshare Setting

The rural setting yielded 7.7% of the number of rides that the urban setting did and had 3.2% of the drivers that the urban setting.  The rural setting produced 10.9% of the urban setting's total fares.  To increase access in the rural setting, it is recommended to increase the number of drivers proportionately to the number of rides.  To potentially increase the affordability to underserved neighborhoods in the rural setting, it is recommended to do further analysis on the distance per ride.  A hypothesis can be made that the rides in the rural setting are significantly higher mileage rides since they have the highest fare per ride and per driver.  A further analysis could help determine if it is feasible to give a discount in rate once a certain distance is reached during a ride versus the price of gas or mileage.
